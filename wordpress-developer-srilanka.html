            <p>I am a <b>senior WordPress Developer in Sri Lanka</b>. I use WordPress as my main CMS platform for web
                development.
                I provide various <b>WordPress web development services and WordPress consultation service as WordPress
                    Developer in Sri Lanka</b>.
            </p>

            <h2>What is WordPress (Simple explanation from a WordPress Sri Lanka)</h2>
            <p>Having an online presence is no longer a choice for your businesses, you need to look for the right
                platform to make it more
                appealing and impressive.WordPress is by far the most popular CMS platform at the moment, and used by
                more than 60 million websites,
                including 31% of all web sites across the web use WordPress as their web development platform that
                enables the creation of visually
                appealing websites which are also capable of yielding enriching user experiences. WordPress was released
                on May 27, 2003, by
                Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little. WordPress is built on PHP and MySQL, and licensed under the GPLv2
                license. </p>

            <p>
                There are so many advantages of WordPress.
                <br>
                <br>
                1. <b>Ease of Use</b><br>
                WordPress is very easy to use and has an very user friendly admin interface. Adding new pages, blog
                posts and uploading images to your website is a breeze and can be done quickly. Because managing
                WordPress is so simple and time spent on formatting is greatly reduced.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. <b>No HTML Editing or FTP Software Required</b><br>
                Before we have CMS platforms like WordPress, users required HTML editing software to add or update
                content. And to upload the content you need FTP software. Now using WordPress you can create a new
                page/post, format text, upload images, upload documents, video files, image galleries very easily
                without the need for additional HTML or FTP software.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. <b>Search Engines Love WordPress Sites</b><br>
                WordPress is SEO friendly. The code behind WordPress is very clean and simple, making it easy for search
                engines to read and index your website content. In addition, each page, post, and image can have its own
                meta tag keywords, description, and title and users have full control in customizeing the meta details.
                You can also use tags to further enhance your search engine optimization efforts.
                <br>
                <br>
                4.<b> You Have Control of Your Site</b><br>
                No more waiting for your web developer to make simple changes to your website. With WordPress, you have
                control of nearly every aspect of your website and can easily make those simple changes yourself.
                <br>
                <br>
                5. <b>The Design of Your Website is 100% Customizable</b><br>
                The look and feel of your WordPress website can be 100% customized so your brand can shine through on
                your site and provide a unique experience to your visitors.
                <br>
                <br>
                6. <b>Extend the Functionality of Your Site with WordPress Plugins</b><br>
                Want to add an event calendar, contact form, video gallery, Facebook Fan Box, and more to your WordPress
                website? WordPress makes this possible with their plugins, most of which are free or very reasonably
                priced.
                <br>
                <br>
                7. <b>Your Website Can Grow as Your Business Grows</b><br>
                WordPress websites are very scalable. You can have thousands of pages or blog posts on your website and
                the performance of the site will not be compromised in the least.
                <br>
                <br>
                8. <b>Have Multiple Users</b><br>
                As an administrator of your website, you can set-up multiple users in WordPress for the website and
                assign access user levels and capabilities to each user.</p>
